I could've stayed home
A promise I made
But we gotta face the change of plans

There's no other night
There's no better trade
I'm back on my feet I gotta dance

'Cause we gonna reclaim the street (Uh-huh)
And get to the heat of the beat, so

Give me the night
Get me satisfaction
Give me the night
Dancing in the dark
Give me the night
You're my prized attraction
Give me the night
The best is yet to come

We traveled so far
I'm ready to float
Tonight is the night we take a break

The pressure is high
I'm ready to blow
It feels like the ground's about to quake

'Cause we gonna reclaim the street (Uh-huh)
And get to the heat of the beat, so

Give me the night
Get me satisfaction
Give me the night
Dancing in the dark
Give me the night
You're my prized attraction
Give me the night
The best is yet to come

Give me the night
Get me satisfaction
Give me the night
Dancing in the dark
Give me the night
You're my prized attraction
Give me the night
The best is yet to come

The best is yet to come
The best is yet, the best is yet, the best is yet to come

Give me the night
Get me satisfaction
Give me the night
Dancing in the dark
Give me the night
You're my prized attraction
Give me the night
The best is yet to come

Give me the night
The best is yet to come
