Whenever dark is falling
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
'Til the day is dawning
We can throw out all the blues and hit the city lights

'Cause there's music in the air and lots of loving everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night

You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction
We'll see the people of the world coming out to dance

'Cause there's music in the air and lots of loving everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night

And if we stay together
We'll find the rhythm of the evening taking us up high
Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street 'til the morning light

'Cause there's music in the air and lots of loving everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night

'Cause there's music in the air and lots of loving everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
